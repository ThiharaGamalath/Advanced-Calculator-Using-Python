# Advanced Calculator Using Python

This project implements a graphical user interface (GUI) calculator using Python. It provides a simple and intuitive way to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Features

- User-friendly graphical interface.
- Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Allows input via mouse clicks and keyboard.
- Error handling for invalid inputs.
- Clear button to reset the calculator.
- Responsive design for various screen sizes.

## Technologies Used

- Python: Programming language used for the backend logic.
- Tkinter: Standard GUI toolkit for Python used to create the graphical interface.
- Git: Version control system for tracking changes and collaborating with others.
